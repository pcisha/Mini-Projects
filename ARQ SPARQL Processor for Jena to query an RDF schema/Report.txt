Z636: DATA SEMANTICS
ASSIGNMENT 6: Java code on using reasoner and SPARQL queries
DEVELOPER: Prachi Shah
DATE: 11/30/2014

Description:
The program is divided in two modules:
1. SPARQL queries on RDF data using Inference model:
	1.1. Create a base RDF Model.
	1.2. Model reads the .rdf file.
	1.3. Create an Inference model using RDFS Reasoner over the above base model.
	1.4. Check if the inference model is valid and print this result.
	1.5. Create a SPARQL query to query the above inference model and return 'family names' and 'given names' as output results. Print the results.
	1.6. Create a SPARQL query to query the above inference model and return 'names' and 'age'  of people who have age>40, as output results. Print the results.

2. Jena Reasoner with rules using Inference model:
    2.1. A Turtle (.ttl) data file has some data stored in it.
    2.2. I specify a Transitivity property rule via the Jena Reasoner.
    2.3. Output returns the derived transitivity properties' result. For example, if x -> y, y -> z, the result returns x -> z.
    2.4. Here, the Reasoner parses this rule and applies it on the model (.ttl file) to display the results.

	
Tools:
Eclipse IDE, Java, Jena API, ARQ Engine 


Results:
1. Display whether the Inference model is valid.
2. Two SPARQL queries on RDF data.
3. Jena Reasoner with Transitivity Rules and Derivations.


Files:
​1. Java class file: jenaSparql.java
2. RDF Data File: vc-db-1.rdf (for SPARQL queries​)
3. Output Screen-shot: assignment 6_output.txt.
4. Turtle data file: .ttl file (Reasoner with rules).
